## Statement
```
It is possible to place 8 queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
Thus, it requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.Given a placement of 8 queens on the chessboard. 
If there is a pair of queens that violates this rule, print YES, otherwise print NO. The input consists of eight coordinate pairs,
one pair per line, with each pair giving the position of a queen on a standard chessboard with rows and columns numbered from 1 to 8.
```
## Sample Input
```
1 5
2 3
3 1
4 7
5 2
6 8
7 6
8 4
```
## Code
```
row=[]
col=[]
num=8
for i in range(num):
  a,b = [int(s) for s in input().split()]
  row.append(int(a))
  col.append(int(b))

res=1
for i in range(num):
  for j in range(i+1,num):
    if(row[i]==row[j] or col[i]==col[j] or abs(row[i]-row[j])==abs(col[i]-col[j])):
      res=0
if res:    
  print("No")
else:
  print("Yes")
```
## Sample Output
```
NO
